## Description
This project creates a good read me for any project. This application takes in information from the command line and
turns it into an md file with all of the information needed for a stranger to understand your project. This application required both an understanding of JS and also an understanding of how to use Node to utilize information from the command line. While there were some struggles putting together the components to get badges for licensing I ended up with three function that now put together the badges, sites and formats of the Licensing to help the user properly license and
of their work.

## Installation
Since this project is not a deployed site a user would need to fork a copy from the original GitHub repository and run it in their own system like VS code or a terminal within gitHub. 

## Usage
To use this application the user must start by navigating to the folder within their terminal or bash. Once
there, the user needs to type in `node index.js` this will prompt them with multiple questions that the user can answer with information from their site. After the user has answered all of the questions the ReadMe.md file will be created with their responses.
